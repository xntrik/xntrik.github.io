<p>It's the 27th of January, 2018. And yes, I've just signed into Google's Advanced Protection.. let's see how this goes.</p>
<p>Boringly.. it goes boringly.</p>
<p>I think the only hurdle was that apparently I had signed into YouTube on the TV. I don't even really remember doing that. Apart from that, this hadn't changed my usage of my gmail account (which I effectively live out of) at all. Oh, and the OS X native integration (which apparently I'd turned on for calendar?) also stopped working</p>
<p>I should probably provide some context. For those that don't know, Advanced Protection is an optional security configuration for your Google account that does a few things. First and foremost, it requires the use of hardware 2FA to sign in. The only reason I actually did this is because during the Enigma conference, Google were handing out these rad little kits which included the following:
<ol><li>Bluetooth, USB (with cable) and NFC dongle</li>
<li>USB-A, NFC dongle</li></ol></p>
<p>So after having a chat with the mostly bored Google engineer behind the counter, I grabbed a kit and went on my way. A week or so later, I sat down with my devices and got cracking. Now, your mileage may vary, especially if you have old, or different devices. My setup is fairly conducive to Advanced Protection, namely:
<ul><li>Google Android Pixel 2 phone</li>
<li>MacBook Pro (personal and work), running the Chrome browser</li>
<li>A Samsung ChromeBook</li></ul></p>
<p>The other key controls that Advanced Protection enables include:
<ul><li>You can only sign in
